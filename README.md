# EZventory
An Inventory management system for small organizations!

## Description
Originally designed for my former high school's Student Council, EZventory has all the features you need to run a keep track of a small organization's inventory. Some of the most interesting features: Save data to the cloud (AWS) and acess it across any android device, export data to a CSV for easy editing in Excel/Google Sheets, and in-app sorting of items based on price or storage location. Communicates with a [backend](https://github.com/DinuWije/InventoryAppBackend) to store data in a MySQL database.
